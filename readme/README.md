## Introduction

Motivation for creating the Repo and what it does in a summary. 

## How to run

This probably consists of multiple subsections on the basics of new installation for Production scripts or applications.

### Prerequisites
might include dependancies, frameworks, hardware, etc.

### Installation
might include os integration through install scripts or creation of autorun, etc.

### Troubleshooting
might not be neccsasarry but common errors or hangups, known bugs

## Architecture Overview

This is where you talk about the archetecture, functionality integration, dataflow, etc.

## Design Process

Discuss design and why code looks the way it does, including things like challenges / drawbacks, additional features during design process. Might include multiple subsections for in-depth process documentation. If multiple sections, use this area for the Planning phase documentation

### Analysis
Scope, Requirements, Risk Analysis.

### Development
Design specification and protoype/testing loop

### Implimentation 
support, maintainence, evaluation
